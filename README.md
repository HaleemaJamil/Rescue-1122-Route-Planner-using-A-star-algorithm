# Rescue-1122-Route-Planner-using-A-star-algorithm
Rescue 1122 Route Planner is a term project which implements the A-star algorithm using Python and the simulation is done using Pygame.
Essentially a start and goal are defined by the user in a 2D grid along with the several blockages/hurdles placed all over the grid. The program is written using python uses A star algorithm to find the most optimal path from the start to the goal if it exits. Pygame is used to simulate the entire program.

In the simulation:
start - orange
goal - turqoise
open nodes - green
closed nodes - red
optimal path - yellow
